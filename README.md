# AgendaProgram README

This is a desktop application built with Java that lets users set up and track their school subjects and assignments. The main view features a monthly calendar, as well as a to-do list for upcoming assignments. Users can add new subjects and assignments by clicking on a specific date or time slot in a day schedule view and filling out a form, where past events can also be modified by the user. 

The application was built using object-oriented programming principles and makes use of data structures such as linked lists and arraylists. It also utilizes external libraries such as jdatepicker and javax.swing.
